# The Ahmi A8 story
The Ahmi A8 is a metal 3d printer frame designed specifically to be a full frame replacement for the weak Anet A8 Frame. I designed this frame back in 2017-18 when the Anet A8 was THE inexpensive printer on the market. I hade a small print farm which I ran daily and I used exclusively Anet A8 printers because they where inexpensive and got the job done. Over time I actually developed my own standard little printer i called the Ahmi (which will also be open sourced) that I would use personally, but sold only the frame kits. Around covid I went out of business in a spectacular fashion and shut down my business operations completely. Moved out to a farm and stoped trying to be an entrepreneur. This lasted until into late last year when I decided it was time to put my business hat back on. I am now releasing my kit design as an open source option for people to use. I also hope to start selling them again, tho I’m not sure I will sell Them as Anet A8 frames. They make great 3d printer frames as is. And I’m happy to put measurements, share files. And provide instructions on how to put it together.

I provide links to the openscad playground largly becasue it renders the models way faster than a computer does. there is a whole interesting article to be found on the subject and how they did it.
