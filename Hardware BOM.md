You can purchase the precut frames without hardware [Here](https://theherrerahomestead.farm/product/ahmi-a8-frame/)

Note: There are printable files for both 2020 and 2040 extrusion These extrusion cuts are aproximate. They can be within +-~2mm and you will be fine. These are just the measurements of the kits we sell. 

#### Extra tools needed
The extrusion I purchase work best with M5 or 10-32 taps. So I would suggest taps somewhere in that range. The extrusion I used to prototype from grainger was larger. So I assume the sixe will depend on where you get you extrusion from. you will also want to change the jig head and hole sizes [Here](https://github.com/hh-systems/Ahmi-A8/tree/main/Jigs) to suit your needs. You will also need whatever screw drivers suit the screws you decided to use.
